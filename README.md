MUon (MUD) Data file IO package.

[mudpy] is a lightwieght [Python] package aimed to aid in the analysis of muon spin rotation ([μSR]) and β-detected
nuclear magnetic/quadrupole resonance (β-NMR and β-NQR) data taken at [TRIUMF]. These techniques are similar to
"conventional" nuclear magnetic resonance ([NMR]), but use radioactive nuclei or a [muon] as the [NMR] probe in place
of a stable isotope.

The intended user of [mudpy] is anyone analyzing data in [TRIUMF]'s [MUD] file format.
A key goal of the project is to alleviate much of the technical tedium that is often encountered during any analysis.

[mudpy] has been written to fullfill the following needs:

* Provide a pythonic means of interfacing with [MUD] files in [Python].
* Provide low-level wrappers of the [`mud_friendly`] API.

## Citing

## Installation and Use

### Dependencies

The following packages/applications are needed prior to installation:
- [Python] 3.6 or higher: a dynamically typed programming language. [[install](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)]

### Install Instructions

|  | Command |
|:-- | :--|
From the [PyPI] as user (recommended) | `pip install --user mud-py` |
From the [PyPI] as root | `pip install mud-py` |
From source | `python3 setup.py install` |

Note the hyphen in `mud-py`. The `pip` command should point to a (version 3)
[Python] executable (e.g., `python3`, `python3.9`, etc. - python version must be >=3.9).
If the above does not work, try using `pip3` or `python3 -m pip` instead.
